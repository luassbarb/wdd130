    <p>Hi, my name is Luana Barbosa. I'm brazilian, but I'm living in Leiria, Portugal, 
    for more than one year. I served as a missionary and returned to my home in 2016, 
    after living for 18 months in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais (Brazil). I served as
    a missionary and returned to my home in 2016, after living for 18 months in Belo
    Horizonte, Minas Gerais (Brazil). I currently work at a multinational company
    producing bread, but I'm studying to become a frontend developer. I joined the 
    course to learn to program from scratch and it has been a motivating and fun 
    experience. In this space I will share some of my work and hobbies. I'm excited 
    to learn more about HTML. I love creating websites and I'm always looking for 
    new design ideas. I developed this page to share some of what I'm learning. And 
    nothing better than learning in practice, right? In my free time, I like to cook,
     watch series and spend time with my family.
